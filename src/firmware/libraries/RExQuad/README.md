# RExQuad Arduino library
This library is meant to store the common Arduino code used by most of the scripts in the `firmware` folder. This includes things like:
- `motors.hpp` which contains a class for working with the brushless motors
- `sensors.hpp` which contains a couple classes for interfacing with the IMU
- `serial_utils.hpp` for a few helper functions for printing useful information over the serial port
- `quad_utils.hpp` for some other useful classes such as the Heartbeat class.
